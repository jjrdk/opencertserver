# opencertserver.acme.abstractions

This project defines core abstractions and interfaces for the ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) protocol within the OpenCertServer ecosystem. It provides models and contracts used by both ACME client and server implementations, ensuring consistent communication and extensibility.

## Functionality
- Contains shared models and service interfaces for ACME operations
- Used as a dependency by both ACME client and server projects

## Dependencies
- Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens (for cryptographic primitives)

This project is not intended to be used directly, but as a foundational library for other ACME-related components.
